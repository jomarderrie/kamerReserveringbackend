# springboot-react-room-reservation

The goal of this project is to implement an application called `kamerreservering` to manage, create and reserve rooms. For it, we will implement a back-end application called `kamerreserveringbackend` using [`Spring Boot`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/) and a font-end application called `kamerreserveringfrontend`[github link](https://github.com/NathanGanesh/kamerreserveringfrontend) using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). Besides, i will use spring security and a sql database for securing the application. 
### instructions

- ### kamerreserveringbackend

  `Spring Boot` Web Java backend application that exposes a Rest API to create, retrieve and delete rooms with reservation. If a user has `ADMIN` role he/she can also retrieve information of other users or delete them. The application secured endpoints can just be accessed if a valid basic auth token is provided.

  In order to get the basic auth access token, the user can login using the credentials (`username` and `password`) created when he/she signed up directly to the application. it uses becrypt to encrypt the password

  `kamerreserveringbackend` stores its data in h2 database.

  `kamerreserveringbackend` has the following endpoints
  | Endpoint                                                      | Secured | Roles           |

- ### kamerreserveringfrontend

  `ReactJS` frontend application where a user with role `USER` can retrieve the information about rooms and their reservation. On the other hand, a user with role `ADMIN` has access to all secured endpoints, including endpoints to create and delete rooms and reservations.
  
  In order to access the application, a `user` or `admin` can login using the credentials. the login for an normal user is pokemon@gmail.com and password Pokemon!23 and for the admin user admin@gmail.com and password AdminUser!1. These credentials should be seeded on application startup. 
  
  
  `kamerreserveringfrontend` uses [`React styled components`](https://styled-components.com/) as CSS-styled framework.
